for unsigned
```c
unsigned int myvariable = 4294967294;
 printf("%u",myvariable);

```
scanf
```c
scanf("%d", &b);
//%f for float* and %lf for double*.
```
> In general, it is best to use scanf as shown here -- to read a single value from the keyboard. Use multiple calls to scanf to read multiple values. In any real program, you will use the gets or fgets functions instead to read text a line at a time. Then you will "parse" the line to read its values. The reason that you do that is so you can detect errors in the input and handle them as you see fit.

A
Entered character is: A
